# ECE 110

Self-driving Arduino car final project for ECE 110

Features:
* Two motors set up to be controlled from the Arduino through PWM
* Photosensor that inhibits the car's movement
* Speaker that plays a tone when the car is not moving

Circuit and Arduino files are present in this repository.
